      "description": "I am Niha and a part-time Masters student pursing data science and Engineering specialisation in SMU. I am always open to new learning experiences and I am excited to start exploring this new area of interest through the IS415 Geospatial Analytics and Applications module.It is my first time exposure to not only Geospatial Anlaytics but also R programming language. So the aim is to learn and document the process in this blog through hands-on exercises where I will be using various R packages to apply the Geospatial Anlytics techniques to real life data applications",
